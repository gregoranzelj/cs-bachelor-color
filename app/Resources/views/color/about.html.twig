        <p>
            My name is Lukas Stratmann and I study computer science at the
            <a href="http://www.uni-paderborn.de">University of Paderborn</a>

            This website is the product of my Bachelor's thesis with the title
            "Conceptualization and Prototypical Implementation in WebGL of an Exercise in Color Theory".
